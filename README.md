# Peculiar datasets

🚀👾🌵🗿 **Open call for peculiar datasets:** 🚀👾🌵🗿

single bananas in the supermarket shelves, summer bruises, shadows of risk society, error screens, broken hardrives, people falling asleep next to Harrari's books, Google translated t-shirts, elbows funks, whatever you feel attached to!
May it be quirky data, mundane data, engaged data, forgotten data, endangered data, neglected data, situated data, insignificant data, Object Oriented Ontologist data, etc.


### 🐧 Why ? 🐧
Data is there, everywhere around you and in your hand, in the technologies you rely on, in the algorithms which judge you in the emerging surveillance apparatus. While data is obsessively -and often non consensualy- scraped, aggregated, measured, interpreted, it becomes this operational reality in an inherently social & political way, which changes the way we relate to the world, and to ourselves. Datasets, as the machine learning algorithms they power, are tangibly surfacing a certain worldview, and revealing some underlying structures, dysfunctions or bias in our minds, history and society. In times where the majority of pictures is created for machines, and Big Data wildy outscales us in smoggy quantified shadows, we, as individuals, often feel alienated from these processes.

We want to deconstruct these visions of data collection, and the segmentation of the world they vehiculate. We want to switch from a massive & exploitative capitalistic data accumulation to a collective sharing amateur circle hacking these normative taxonomies: the **Peculiar Data Circle**.

Somehow, these handmade datasets are meant to exist elsewhere, out of the capitalocene, in the narrated layers of the Chthulucene, in the autopoietic inter and intra-personal, in the tentacular non-anthropocentred, in the bizarre and in the mundane. What if they could be a medium to surface alternative worlding narratives and practices of *becoming-with* ... *"all those in the muddle"*?

Once a dataset, once a reality.🌈 

### 🐠 How ? 🐠
Via Github (here, pull request), or via email ( soundslike003@gmail.com ), reach us, and share your dataset with our Peculiar Data Circle. You can look at the *"_template"* in the datasets folder. 💫 
It will soon be posted online, stay tuned! 
Any question, feedback, suggestion? We would be glad to hear from you !

This is an open source and participative project, conceived as a civic reappropriation of datasets, launched in fall 2019.
